# Rosary App – Version 1
##### A Basic C Sharp and MySql Connector ADO App

* I have not touched this code for about a year since posting it. I may have modified some comments, but the structure and design is pretty much the same.

* I consolidated it to be Git friendly. The previous post was just a glorified Gist previewing key script which makes this application work.

## An ADO.NET MySql Connector Devotional Pamphlet Application
### (App Development Example)

This app was developed using Visual Studio with the MySql Connector ADO.NET Plugin

This is source code for VS12. You can either build and export it yourself, or you can view the [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLw9K8jhlSk) to see it in action.

###### Links to my other Versions:

> [Version 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLw9K8jhlSk): WinForm (Rosary + Religious Scripture / Bible Database)
* This was the best and my most prayerful version. But it was in WinForm. Its value to others would be comparable to the use of Latin in a mainstream Catholic Church. It would convey deep meaning and reverence, but nobody can use it unless they know, and value, how the Past used to work.

> [Version 2](http://mezcel.wixsite.com/rosary): WCF/WPF (Multi User Social Rosary Prayer Group)
* This version is my most Advanced version. It synchronizes multiple users as they join and exit a rosary prayer group. It is plug and play on any Wi-Fi router network. It bypasses and surpasses the limitations of the “newer and better ASP.NET. There is a chat room. The Prayer Leader or “Host Server” can change ownership to anyone active on the same prayer circle.

> [Version 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnw_XRBKW8Y&t=24s): jQuery Mobile (Stand Alone Rosary Bead Set)
* This version is my most practical. No extraordinary bells and whistles. It is the most “cross-platform” of the three. This one will actually get used and shared. Unfortunately it is the least visually appealing of the three.
