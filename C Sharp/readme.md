## The Zip File Is Not Part Of This App

> The Zip file attached is Irrelevant to this app. It was salvaged code from a different WinForm Version 1 of my Rosary App series.
> I just wanted to save it somewhere public and accessible. I don’t even know if that code compiles.
> I have gone through many computers and each of those computers have been wiped clean multiple times. 
> That was the only fully contained folder I could salvage from the past.
