#### Legacy Support Files for VS12 IDE

**About:** VS 2017 and Oracle are phasing out support for VS2010 and older. I suspect VS 2012 will be in N/A soon. These legacy files will keep the script relevant on personal Win6-Win10 machines.

***What I Use:*** I prefer to use MySql Workbench ```mysql-workbench-community-6.3.6-winx64``` I did not enclose it, nor ```mysql-installer-community-5.7.10.0```. I have it saved offline if Oracle drops it from their DB Repo. Call me if google doesn't help.

    The MySql provided by WAMPP is a nice alternative to Oracle, since their site is expected to continue to keep changing what programs they actively choose to support.

#### Python and Server aside... you need the following to develop programs on VS12:

* mysql-for-visualstudio-1.2.6.msi
* mysql-connector-net-6.9.8.msi
