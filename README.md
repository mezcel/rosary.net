## About

> [Version 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLw9K8jhlSk): WinForm (Rosary + Religious Scripture / Bible Database)

* This was the best and my most prayerful version. But it was in WinForm. Its value to others would be comparable to the use of Latin in a mainstream Catholic Church. It would convey deep meaning and reverence, but nobody can use it unless they know, and value, how the Past used to work.

> [Version 2](http://mezcel.wixsite.com/rosary): WCF/WPF (Multi User Social Rosary Prayer Group)

* This version is my most Advanced version. It synchronizes multiple users as they join and exit a rosary prayer group. It is plug and play on any Wi-Fi router network. It bypasses and surpasses the limitations of the “newer and better ASP.NET. There is a chat room. The Prayer Leader or “Host Server” can change ownership to anyone active on the same prayer circle.
* __Client-Client__ (Multiple clients can interface with each other in both ```event controls``` or with ```chat```)
* __Client-Server__ (The DB also doubles as a reliable way to synchronize even specific controls on different stages of the app's progress)
* __TCP/IP Plug/Play__ Features (Connect to a router, my app design handles the rest)

#### Cross-Platform Web Browser Version (not .NET)

> [Version 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnw_XRBKW8Y&t): jQuery Mobile (Stand Alone Rosary Bead Set)

* This version is my most practical. No extraordinary bells and whistles. It is the most “cross-platform” of the three. This one will actually get used and shared. Unfortunately it is the least visually appealing of the three.
