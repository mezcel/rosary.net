# Windows.NET Rosary Prayer Community (App Development)

Developed on Visual Studio with MySql Connector ADO.NET Plugin

The Client GUI WPF is not posted yet, I still need to clean out all of the residual, unused test bench processes, hidden throughout the program.

The working Demo is complete, but the documentation write up is still under construction.

I am making a web page just to illustrate the organization and purpose of this coding project.
